IAM Users and Groups

- IAM = Identity and Access Management, Global Service
- Root account created by default, shouldn't be used or shared
- Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped
- Groups only contain users, not other groups
- Users don't have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups


IAM Permissions

- Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies.
- These policies define permissions of the users.
- In AWS you apply the least privilege principle: don't give more permissions that a user needs.


IAM Policies

* Inline policy - A policy that is only attached to a user.
* IAM Policy Structure - Consists of:
	
	* Version: policy language version, always include "2012-10-17"
	* Id: an identifier for the policy (optional)
	* Statement: one or more individual statements (required)
	
  Statement Consists of:
  	
  	* Sid: an identifier for the statement (optional)
  	* Effect: whether the statement allows or denies access (Allow, Deny)
  	* Principal: account/user/role to which this policy applied to
  	* Action: list of actions this policy allows or denies
  	* Condition: conditions for when the policy is in effect (optional) 



AWS can be accessed in the following ways:

1) AWS Management Console (protected by password + MFA)
2) AWS Command Line Interface (CLI): Protected by access keys
3) AWS Software Developer Kit (SDK): for code: protected by access keys


IAM Roles for Services

- Some AWS service will need to perform actions on your behalf
- We assign permissions to AWS services with IAM Roles
- Common roles:
	* EC2 Instance Roles
	* Lambda Function Roles
	* Roles for CloudFormation
	
	
IAM Security Tools 

- IAM Credentials Report (account-level)
	* A report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials.
	
- IAM Access Advisor (user-level)
	* Access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed.
	* You can use this information to revise your policies.
	
	
IAM Guidelines & Best Practices :

- Don't use the root account except for AWS account setup.
- One physical user = One AWS user
- Assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups
- Create a strong password policy
- Use and enforce the use of Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Create and use Roles for giving permissions to AWS services
- Use Access Keys for Programmatic Access (CLI / SDK)
- Audit permissions of you account using IAM Credentials Report & IAM Access Advisor
- Never share IAM users and Access keys.
