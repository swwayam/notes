- EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
- It mainly consists in the capability of:
	* Renting virtual machines (EC2)
	* Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
	* Distributing load across machines (ELB)
	* Scaling the services using auto-scaling group (ASG)


- EC2 sizing & configuration options
	* Operating System (OS): Linux, Windows or Mac OS
	* How much compute power & cores (CPU)
	* How much random-access memory (RAM)
	* How much storage space:
		- Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
		- Hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
	* Network card: speed of the card, Public IP address
	* Firewall rules: security group
	* Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data.	


- EC2 User Data
	* It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User Data script.
	* bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts.
	* That sript is only run once at the instance first start.
	* EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
		- Installing updates
		- Installing software
		- Downloading common files from the internet
		- Anything you can think of
	* The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user
	

- EC2 Instance Types - Overview
	* You can use different types of EC2 instances that are optimised for different use cases.
	* General Purpose, Compute Optimized, Memory Optimized, Accelerated Computing, Storage Optimized, Instance Features, Measuring Instance Performance.
	
	* AWS has following naming convention:
	 - m: instance class
	 - 5: generation (AWS improves them over time)
	 - 2xlarge: size within the instance class


- EC2 Instance Types - General Purpose:
	* Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
	* Balance between:
		^Compute 
		^Memory
		^Networking
