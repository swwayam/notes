Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)


Overview 

- The Lifecycle refers to a set of defined steps that we have to follow as we create software, especially if we want that software to be high-quality.
- SDLC is a methodology that defines the steps needed for software development teams to create great software.
- It covers everything from the objective (the problems that we are trying to solve with out software) to the deployment of the solution (the software itself).
- It's a cycle because deploying the solution is not only the last step in an iteration; It also marks the start of a new.


Stages - 

1) Plan Stage

- Developers should determine the costs and resources needed to create the solution during this plan.

2) Design

- A team would ofter define the solution's structure, such as the way an app may connect to a server or a database. Following a design pattern.

3) Code 

- Knowing the requirements, the resources limitations, and the solution's structure. It's time to start coding.

4) Testing 

- A team must test against the requirements to ensure that the solution meets them. The team should also test for defects - the dreaded bugs - and let the developers know of any issues.

5) Deployment

- Deployment stage is both the final step and the first one since it will mark the beginning of the next iteration.


Reasons for not building a feature / idea -

1) The value isn't there 

- Either too few users will benefit from this, or the feature barely has any positive impact.

2) The usability isn't there

- A feature may be valuable, but no one will use it if it is too complicated to operate.

3) The feasibility isn't there

- It is possible that with the current resources, a solution may be impossible to create, or it may draw focus away from more critical objectives.

4) The business viability isn't there

- It may not make financial sense to implement a feature. This one is tricky for enterprise companies with legacy solutions that may be threatened by innovative teams.
