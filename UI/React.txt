React -

* Components -

Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

Components come in two types, Class components and Function components, in this tutorial we will concentrate on Function components.

* Props -

Props is the data that we pass to a component 

- note - If a prop value changes the whole component is re-rendered / repainted. It's part of component lifecycle.


* State 

State refers to current condition of a systems or data at a specific point in time.


* useContext() Hook -

enables functional components to access context values. This hook helps avoid the problem of "prop drilling," where props are passed down multiple levels from parent to child components, making the code less readable and harder to maintain.


Steps for usage -

1) First need to create a context using React.createContext()
2) Then wrap the components that need to access the context with a provider component.
