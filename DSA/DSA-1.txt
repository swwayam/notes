Time Complexity Analysis:

* Time complexity is a measure of the number of operations performed per input data. Rate of change of operations with the size of the input.

* While computing Time Complexity one should always consider worst case scenarios. Which is represented by bigO i.e O()

Some Common Annotations :

1) O(n) for linear operations
2) O(1) for constant operations


Space Complexity Analysis:

* Space complexity is a measure of the amount of space requried to run the program / algorithm.


TC and SC are inversely proportional, meaning if you optimize of space time increases and vice-versa. This is true most of the time, though there are some exceptions.




Arrays:

1) Heterogenous Arrays: Arrays containing different datatypes
2) Homogenous Arrays: Arrays containing same datatypes
