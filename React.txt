* Components -

Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

Components come in two types, Class components and Function components, in this tutorial we will concentrate on Function components.

* Props -

Props is the data that we pass to a component 

- note - If a prop value changes the whole component is re-rendered / repainted. It's part of component lifecycle.
