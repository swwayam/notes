1) How brain works - Neuro Plasticity

* What is Neuro Plasticity? 

- The actions that you take builds a neural connection, the neural connections can be weaken or broken on the actions that you take. These connection can become dormant as well as ineffective.

* Why it's difficult to form new habbits 

- When we start by doing something new, new neural connections are formed in our brain but these are weak connections and after few days we revert back to our old habbits. This happens because the connection of the new habbit is weak and the connections for older habbit is still strong. To make a strong neural connection repetition is the key (repetition of new habbit).

Doing this will make the old connection dormant or ineffective but it will still be there and at any given time we can switch back to the old habbits.


2) How success works: Formula for Success (Part 1)


- Success is a process

Success is = Showing up to work everyday consistently + Evolving the system by rapid problem solving.

- Your system should be constently evolving, Initial days your error rate will be more, the dropout rate will be higher. You need to evaluate, understand yourself on :

a) How you brain works?
b) What things best work for me?
c) What are the things that trigger a chance of error / failure?
d) How can I avoid C?
e) If C occurs what steps to take?
f) What is the best time to wake up?
g) What diet works on you?

- Goal is to bring the failure rate down and increase the chance of success.



3) How success works: Pareto Principle (Part 2)


- Pareto Principle States : 80% percent of results / output you achieve is just from 20% of the work.

- When you start with new habbits you will have an 80% failure rate and 20% of success rate.

- In the next 4 weeks you need to make this 60-40.

- When you start you won't get instant results instead you will see that 20% of things are going good and 80% of your plan / system is messed up and in confusion. Look for the things that aren't working for you and think on chainging it and the 20% things that are working for you, Double down on them look for thinks that you can build and repeat from this 20%.


Remember - Things will take time.


A system is good when there is a 65% to 70% of success rate. A system cannot be 100% success and 0% failure. There is always and human element to it.


- The Goal is to have a high success rate of the system so that your performance is outstanding.


You need to adopt things and make your own. Learn to internalize the things.
